Green Accounting

Environmental accounts have been in the air for decades. As early as the 1970s, a few European countries were experimenting with ways to build environmental data into their national accounts, and by the late 1980s the United Nations and other international organizations were beginning to organize the proliferation of methods  that had been proposed to build the accounts. 
The accounting work may be organized into three broad components:
 * accounting for  physical ﬂows related to the environment, accounting for natural resource assets, and constructing environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators.
 * The broad areas of pollution and environmental protection expenditures fall into the  component, which has primarily been addressed in developing countries where pollution is a major problem.
 * The second covers forests, minerals, land and water, tracking how they change over time in both physical and monetary units; this has been more important than the  accounts in resource-dependent developing countries.
 * The third component encompasses what is popularly referred to as **“GREENGDP”**.
